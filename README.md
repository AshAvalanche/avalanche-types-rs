## Introduction

The `avalanche-types` crate implements and is the canonical representation of Avalanche primitive types in Rust.  Avalanche types are separated by modules and are all under the `src` directory.

This crate also provides an SDK library for developing subnets in Rust. For the SDK functionality, see `src/subnet` which contains everything required to build a subnet VM in Rust.

The following VMs were built with the SDK:
* Simple Rust VM: [TimestampVM](https://github.com/ava-labs/timestampvm-rs)
* Complex Rust VM: [SpacesVM](https://github.com/ava-labs/spacesvm-rs)

## Getting Started

Examples can be found in [`examples`](./examples) and is a good first step to getting an understanding of general usage.

### Tutorials

- [How to Build a Simple Rust VM](https://docs.avax.network/subnets/create-a-simple-rust-vm) tutorial provides a basic example of using the Rust SDK.

### Rust Version

`avalanche-types` currently works on Rust `1.67` and above as it requires support for the 2021 edition. This project uses the stable toolchain.

## Features

- Ids (e.g., [`src/ids`](./src/ids))
- Transaction types/serialization (e.g., [`src/platformvm/txs`](./src/platformvm/txs))
- Certificates (e.g., [`src/key/cert`](./src/key/cert))
- Keys and addresses (e.g., [`src/key/secp256k1`](./src/key/secp256k1))
- Peer-to-peer messages (e.g., [`src/message`](./src/message))
- RPC chain VM (e.g., [`src/subnet/rpc`](./src/subnet/rpc))
- Genesis generate helper (e.g., [`src/subnet_evm`](./src/subnet_evm))
- Protobuf generated stubs and helpers (e.g., [`src/proto`](./src/proto))

The basic types available in this crate are used in other Avalanche Rust projects (e.g., distributed load tester [`blizzard`](https://talks.gyuho.dev/distributed-load-generator-avalanche-2022.html), [`avalanche-ops`](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-ops)).
